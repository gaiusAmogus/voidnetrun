The game works by having the player's object, a ship model, and a camera that are constantly moving forward. Navigation is made possible via the arrow keys changing the flight path of the ship, and the space bar firing a bullet (a cylinder emitting light every fraction of a second upon firing, made so for optimization purposes).</br></br>As for objectives, there are a total of 15 enemy spaceships scattered across the map which aim to shoot the player. If the player is hit by the enemy bullet, one of their three lives is taken away (with every gone resulting in “Game Over”), however if the player hits the enemy ship with their bullet, it adds a point to their overall score. The aim is to get as high of a score as possible in this infinite simulation. Many optimizations have been made to allow this browser game to run smoothly, such as the enemy ships only turning to face the player when shooting, and instead of rendering a new enemy ship upon getting hit, it simply instantly transports it to another location, giving the same illusion.</br></br>The environment which the player navigates through is generated at random, with planet-like being positioned differently each time the web page is refreshed (hitting such obstacle results in instant “Game Over”). The skybox was made to move alongside the ship so that the player is unable to exit the experience, remaining immersed in the gameplay.",
